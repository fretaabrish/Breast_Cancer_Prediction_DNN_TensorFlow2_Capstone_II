# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
## Overview
This project applies Deep Learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to assist radiologists by developing an automated detection system based on Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) sample images.

Our model, built with TensorFlow (Keras), achieved exceptional performance, with an AUC score of 0.9967 and an accuracy of 98.25%.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle â€“ Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset
- Data Composition:
  - 62.7% Benign tumors
  - 37.3% Malignant tumors
